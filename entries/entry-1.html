    <h3 class="left-text">step one</h3>
    <p class="left-text">start with the green side of the paper facing up. fold it in half horizontally, crease it well then unfold it.</p>

    <h3 class = "right-text">step 2</h3>
    <p class = "right-text">fold it in half vertically, crease it well then unfold it.</p>

    <h3 class="left-text">step 3</h3>
    <p class="left-text">flip it over.</p>

    <h3 class = "right-text">step 4</h3>
    <p class = "right-text">fold it in half diagonally, getting a crease, and unfold it.</p>

    <h3 class="left-text">step 5</h3>
    <p class="left-text">fold it in half diagonally from the other side, crease it well then unfold.</p>

    <h3 class = "right-text">step 6</h3>
    <p class = "right-text">now, use both hands to press the two middle points on the right and left edges. then push it down to make the two middle points meet the center point of the bottom edge. flatten the fold to get a triangle.</p>

    <h3 class="left-text">step 7</h3>
    <p class="left-text">fold the right edge to the left along the dotted line, ensure that the right edge meets the middle point of the bottom edge, and the right corner goes over the bottom edge. crease it well then unfold it. repeat this for the left edge.</p>

    <h3 class = "right-text">step 8</h3>
    <p class = "right-text">fold the left and right corners of the top layer up to the top point diagonally, crease them well, and unfold them.</p>

    <h3 class="left-text">step 9</h3>
    <p class="left-text">bring up the right edge and the right part of the bottom edge along the line connecting the right corner and the intersection point formed by the two creases you just made.</p>

    <h3 class = "right-text">step 10</h3>
    <p class = "right-text">press down the middle part of the right edge, shape the right corner, and then fold it up to the top point, ensuring the bottom right edge aligns with the vertical crease.</p>

    <h3 class="left-text">step 11</h3>
    <p class="left-text">repeat steps 9 to 10 for the left side.</p>

    <h3 class = "right-text">step 12</h3>
    <p class = "right-text">flip the paper over.</p>

    <h3 class="left-text">step 13</h3>
    <p class="left-text">repeat steps 7 to 10 for this side.</p>

    <h3 class = "right-text">step 14</h3>
    <p class = "right-text">take the top right corner, and fold it down along the dotted line.</p>

    <h3 class="left-text">step 15</h3>
    <p class="left-text">flip the model over.</p>

    <h3 class = "right-text">step 16</h3>
    <p class = "right-text">similarly, fold the top left corner down along the dotted line.</p>

    <h3 class="left-text">step 17</h3>
    <p class="left-text">now take the bottom left edge, and fold it up to align with the horizontal line connecting the left and right points.</p>

    <h3 class = "right-text">step 18</h3>
    <p class = "right-text">take the corner you made in the previous step, and fold it to the left along the dotted line.</p>

    <h3 class="left-text">step 19</h3>
    <p class="left-text">still the same corner, fold it down, then lift it to make it stand.</p>

    <h3 class = "right-text">step 20</h3>
    <p class = "right-text">view it from the bottom left to see this flap.</p>

    <h3>step 21</h3>
    <p>press the flap from its top to open it, then flatten it.</p>

    <h3 class = "right-text">step 22</h3>
    <p class = "right-text">flip the model over.</p>

    <h3 class="left-text">step 23</h3>
    <p class="left-text">in the same manner as you did in step 17, fold the bottom right edge up to align with the horizontal line connecting the left and right points.</p>

    <h3 class = "right-text">step 24</h3>
    <p class = "right-text">then fold the corner you made in the previous step to the right along the dotted line.</p>

    <h3 class="left-text">step 25</h3>
    <p class="left-text">still this same corner, fold it down along the dotted line, then lift it to make it stand.</p>

    <h3 class = "right-text">step 26</h3>
    <p class = "right-text">view it from the bottom right.</p>

    <h3 class="left-text">step 27</h3>
    <p class="left-text">press the top point of this flap to open it, then flatten it, as you did in step 21.</p>

    <h3 class = "right-text">step 28</h3>
    <p class = "right-text">now take the left flap, and fold it down to the left along the dotted line.</p>

    <h3 class="left-text">step 29</h3>
    <p class="left-text">flip the paper over.</p>

    <h3 class = "right-text">step 30</h3>
    <p class = "right-text">in the same manner, fold the right flap down to the right along the dotted line, ensuring it overlaps with the flap you made in step 28.</p>

    <h3 class="left-text">step 31</h3>
    <p class="left-text">view it from the top, and make the top two flaps together at the top, and the bottom two flaps together at the bottom. this will change the model from opening on the left and right to opening on the top and bottom. then lay it flat.</p>

    <h3 class = "right-text">step 32</h3>
    <p class = "right-text">fold the bottom left and right corners of the turtle’s body a little backward.</p>

    <h3 class="left-text">step 33</h3>
    <p class="left-text">the corresponding two points on the bottom layer should be folded in the same way.</p>

    <h3 class = "right-text">step 34</h3>
    <p class = "right-text">fold the right flipper down along the dotted line, then lift it 90 degrees.</p>

    <h3 class="left-text">step 35</h3>
    <p class="left-text">view it from the right opening.</p>

    <h3 class = "right-text">step 36</h3>
    <p class = "right-text">press the flap you made in step 34, that is the turtle’s right flipper, then open and flatten it.</p>

    <h3 class="left-text">step 37</h3>
    <p class="left-text">repeat steps 34 to 36 for its left flipper.</p>

    <h3 class = "right-text">step 38</h3>
    <p class = "right-text">turn over the model.</p>

    <h3 class="left-text">step 39</h3>
    <p class="left-text">fold the top point down along the dotted line.</p>

    <h3 class = "right-text">step 40</h3>
    <p class = "right-text">then fold it up along the dotted line.</p>

    <h3 class="left-text">step 41</h3>
    <p class="left-text">open the bottom right corner of the top part, then push this corner, and flatten it.</p>

    <h3 class = "right-text">step 42</h3>
    <p class = "right-text">repeat this for the bottom left corner.</p>

    <h3 class="left-text">step 43</h3>
    <p >fold the top point down a little to form the turtle’s head.</p>

    <h3 class = "right-text">step 44</h3>
    <p class = "right-text">flip the model over. this is the final shape of the origami turtle.</p>
