    <h3>step 1</h3>
    <p>start with a rectangular piece of paper. fold it in half vertically and then unfold it to create a crease.</p>

    <h3>step 2</h3>
    <p>fold the paper in half horizontally.</p>

    <h3>step 3</h3>
    <p>fold the top corners down to meet the center crease. your paper should now look like a triangle with a rectangle underneath.</p>

    <h3>step 4</h3>
    <p>fold the top layer of the rectangle up along the bottom edge of the triangle.</p>

    <h3>step 5</h3>
    <p>mountain fold the bottom layer of the rectangle up behind the triangle.</p>

    <h3>step 6</h3>
    <p>open the paper from the bottom and push in the sides. this should create a diamond shape. tuck the right flap under the left flap on both sides, flattening the model.</p>

    <h3>step 7</h3>
    <p>fold the top flap of the diamond up along the bottom edge of the top triangle. then, flip the model over and
        repeat the fold on the other side.</p>

    <h3>step 8</h3>
    <p>open the paper at the bottom again, similar to step 6. then, gently pull both ends of the paper out until the boat forms.</p>
