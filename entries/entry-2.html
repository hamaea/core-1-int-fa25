    <h3>step 1</h3>
    <p>start with the white side of the paper facing up and fold in half diagonally.</p>

    <h3>step 2</h3>
    <p>fold in half again along the dotted line.</p>

    <h3>step 3</h3>
    <p>fold that flap back and squash fold this flap down.</p>

    <h3>step 4</h3>
    <p>repeat the last few steps on the other side.</p>

    <h3>step 5</h3>
    <p>fold the flap over to the left along the dotted line and squash fold this flap down.</p>

    <h3>step 6</h3>
    <p>fold the side flap to the center along the dotted line. crease this fold well and then unfold it.</p>

    <h3>step 7</h3>
    <p>fold the flap on the other side to the center along the dotted line. crease this well and unfold.</p>

    <h3>step 8</h3>
    <p>fold the top down along the dotted line. crease this well and unfold.</p>

    <h3>step 9</h3>
    <p>lift the top flap of paper up along the crease you just made. continue lifting up and push in the sides along the creases you made in the previous couple of steps. flatten everything along the creases you already made.</p>

    <h3>step 10</h3>
    <p>we’re going to make the same fold on the other side, too.</p>

    <h3>step 11</h3>
    <p>fold the side to the center along the dotted line. crease this well and then unfold.</p>

    <h3>step 12</h3>
    <p>fold the other side to the center along the dotted line. crease this well and unfold.</p>

    <h3>step 13</h3>
    <p>fold the top down along the dotted line. crease this well and unfold.</p>

    <h3>step 14</h3>
    <p>lift the top flap of paper up along the crease you just made. continue lifting up and push in the sides along the creases you made in the previous couple of steps. flatten everything along the creases you already made.</p>

    <h3>step 15</h3>
    <p>at this point, you also have a completed bird base. next, we’re going to fold the neck and the tail. fold the top flap on the right to the center along the dotted line.</p>

    <h3>step 16</h3>
    <p>fold the top flap on the left to the center along the dotted line as well.</p>

    <h3>step 17</h3>
    <p>repeat the last two steps on the other side.</p>

    <h3>step 18</h3>
    <p>fold the top flap on the left to the center along the dotted line.</p>

    <h3>step 19</h3>
    <p>fold the top flap on the right to the center along the dotted line as well.</p>

    <h3>step 20</h3>
    <p>fold the long, thin section of paper on the right up along the dotted line. crease this well and unfold.</p>

    <h3>step 21</h3>
    <p>fold the long, thin section of paper on the left up just like you did on the other side. crease this well and unfold.</p>

    <h3>step 22</h3>
    <p>turn the model over. we’re going to repeat the last couple of steps on the other side.</p>

    <h3>step 23</h3>
    <p>fold the long, thin section of paper on the right up along the dotted line. there’s already a crease here, but now you’re going to fold it the other way. crease this well and unfold.</p>

    <h3>step 24</h3>
    <p>fold the long, thin section of paper on the left up just like you did on the other side. there’s also a crease here already, and you’re also going to fold it the other way. crease this well and unfold.</p>

    <h3>step 25</h3>
    <p>lift the paper up inside the model along the creases you already made and flatten everything.</p>

    <h3>step 26</h3>
    <p>make another inside reverse fold along the creases you already made along the left side of the model. lift the paper up inside the model along the creases you already made and flatten everything.</p>

    <h3>step 27</h3>
    <p>now, we’re going to fold the head. fold the long, thin section of paper on the right down along the dotted line. crease this well and unfold.</p>

    <h3>step 28</h3>
    <p>repeat this on the other side.</p>

    <h3>step 29</h3>
    <p>fold the long, thin section of paper on the left side now down along the dotted line. this is folded the opposite way along the crease you already folded on the other side. crease this well and unfold.</p>

    <h3>step 30</h3>
    <p>turn the model over again so it’s facing the way it was before.</p>

    <h3>step 31</h3>
    <p>make the head by doing an inside reverse fold along the creases you made in the previous couple of steps. the head is then folded inside the neck.</p>

    <h3>step 32</h3>
    <p>fold down the wings on both sides along the dotted line.</p>

    <h3>fin.</h3>
    <p>all done!!!</p>
