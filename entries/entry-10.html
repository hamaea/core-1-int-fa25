    <h2>i HATE spiders.</h2>
    <img src="../images/ORIGAMI SPIDER.png" class="heading-img" alt="origami spider"/>

    <h3 class="left-text">my worst enemy</h3>
    <p class="left-text">i hate them so much that i don't even like watching movies that have them. when i was younger, i never wanted to watch spiderman because it had a spider in it. my dad always told me, "they're good guys, you shouldn't kill them!" and i never did. i made him take them outside.</p>

    <h3 class="right-text">step 1</h3>
    <p class="right-text">start with a rectangular piece of paper. fold it in half vertically and then unfold it to create a crease.</p>

    <h3 class="left-text">step 2</h3>
    <p class="left-text">fold the paper in half horizontally.</p>

    <h3 class="right-text">step 3</h3>
    <p class="right-text">fold the top corners down to meet the center crease. your paper should now look like a triangle with a rectangle underneath.</p>

    <h3 class="left-text">step 4</h3>
    <p class="left-text">fold the top layer of the rectangle up along the bottom edge of the triangle.</p>

    <h3 class="right-text">step 5</h3>
    <p class="right-text">mountain fold the bottom layer of the rectangle up behind the triangle.</p>

    <h3 class="left-text">step 6</h3>
    <p class="left-text">open the paper from the bottom and push in the sides. this should create a diamond shape. tuck the right flap under the left flap on both sides, flattening the model.</p>

    <h3 class="right-text">step 7</h3>
    <p class="right-text">fold the top flap of the diamond up along the bottom edge of the top triangle. then, flip the model over and
        repeat the fold on the other side.</p>

    <h3 class="left-text">step 8</h3>
    <p class="left-text">open the paper at the bottom again, similar to step 6. then, gently pull both ends of the paper out until the boat forms.</p>
