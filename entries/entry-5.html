   <p>this is like for entry 5</p>
   <h4>step 1</h4>
   <p>with the white side up, fold it in half horizontally, crease it well, and then unfold it.<p>
   <h4>step 2</h4>
   <p>fold the paper in half vertically, crease it well, and then unfold it.<p> 
    <h4>step 3</h4>
   <p>fold the top quarter of the paper along the dotted line to the center line. crease this fold well and then unfold it.<p>
   <h4>step 4</h4>
   <p>fold the bottom quarter of the paper along the dotted line to the center line. crease this fold well and then unfold it.<p> 
    <h4>step 5</h4>
   <p>fold the right quarter of the paper along the dotted line to the center line. crease this fold well and then unfold it.<p>
   <h4>step 6</h4>
   <p>fold the left quarter of the paper along the dotted line to the center line. crease this fold well and then unfold it.<p> 
    <h4>step 7</h4>
   <p>fold the paper in half diagonally. crease it well and then unfold it.</p>
   <h4>step 8</h4>
   <p>fold the paper in half diagonally the other way. crease it well and then unfold it.<p> 
    <h4>step 9</h4>
   <p>turn the paper over so the colored side is facing up.</p>
   <h4>step 10</h4>
   <p>fold the corner of the paper to the center along the dotted line. crease this fold well and then unfold it. do the same for all the corners.<p> 
    <h4>step 11</h4>
   <p>turn the paper over so the white side is facing up again.</p>
   <h4>step 12</h4>
   <p>fold the two sides of the paper towards the center along the dotted line. you already have a crease here. only fold the middle half of the paper where the dotted lines are. donâ€™t fold the top or bottom parts of the existing crease. you should have a shape that resembles what you see on the second diagram. fold both the top and bottom of the model along the dotted lines to the center.<p> 
    <h4>step 13</h4>
   <p>fold the bottom two flaps of paper down along the dotted lines.</p>
   <h4>step 14</h4>
   <p>flip model over.<p> 
    <h4>step 15</h4>
   <p>fold the top part of the paper down along the dotted line.</p>
   <h4>step 16</h4>
   <p>flip model over again<p> 
    <h4>step 17</h4>
   <p>fold the top flap of paper on the right along the dotted line towards the center. the dotted line goes from the top corner to halfway down the diagonal line at the bottom, as you can see in the diagram. fold the top flap of paper on the left along the dotted line towards the center. the dotted line goes from the top corner to halfway down the diagonal line at the bottom, as you can see in the diagram.</p>
   <h4>step 18</h4>
   <p>flip model over again!<p> 
    <h4>step 19</h4>
   <p>valley Fold along the dotted line in the direction of the arrow in the diagram. crease this fold well and then unfold it. do the same on the other side in the direction of the arrow in the diagram.</p>
   <h4>step 20</h4>
   <p>pinch the middle of the model along the two folds you just made and form a Mountain Fold along the vertical line in the middle.<p>
