  <h2>i really want a cat</h2>
  <p class="left-text">i've always wanted a cat. i've seen studies that said that having a cat reduces rates of anxiety
    and depression! a
    fix all built into a little cat. when i was 5, i visited my family's home in japan, which had a little black cat.
    the cat chased me everywhere and tried to scratch me even though i wanted to play with it. i remember my dad
    scolding me for provoking it. despite this, i always wanted and still want a cat.</p>
